## Getting Started
### Download the repo and ensure that the latest version of google chrome is installed on the environment
### Navigate to project root directory
### Run command to install dependencies
`$ npm install`

## Running Tests
### To run all test suite
`$ npm run test`

### Test results
1. Test Results are saved in `./results` as json format for each test suite
2. An example screenshot of the spec results was also imported

## What would i do different if i had more time
1. Spend more time to make a few more meaning full assertions on elements on a particular page
2. Create some more edge case testing or unhappy path automation
3. Write tests for UI expectations eg button sizes or colors (implementing a screenshot testing tool like backstopjJS would be sufficient)
